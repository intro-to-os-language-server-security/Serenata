Whoa, there! Thanks for contributing by reporting issues, but before you do, check that you can answer all the following questions with a firm **Yes**:
  * Have I checked the existing open **and** closed issues?
  * If I've just installed or updated...
    * ... have I checked the **CHANGELOG** and the **README**?
    * ... have I tried removing and reinstalling the package and then restarting Atom to ensure Atom didn't break it?
