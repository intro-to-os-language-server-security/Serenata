PHP Integrator is a server that indexes PHP code and performs static analysis. It stores its information in a database
and can retrieve information about your code to clients by communicating over sockets. Clients can use this information
to provide various functionalities, such as autocompletion, code navigation and tooltips.

## Where is it used?
Currently the core package is used to power the php-integrator-* packages for the Atom editor. See also
[the list of projects](https://github.com/php-integrator).
